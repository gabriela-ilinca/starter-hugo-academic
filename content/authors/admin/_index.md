I'm Gabriela Coada, and I am a student at Emory University studying Economics and Computer Science. I am currently working as a summer undergraduate researcher and collaborates with researchers at the Bank of Canada in a project using the Bank’s proprietary yearly Bitcoin Omnibus Survey to investigate cryptocurrency ownership. Some of my skills include pulling data using SQL, data processing with STATA and R, creating maps and other visualizations, and communicating findings to stakeholders.
